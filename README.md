With a potentiometer, you can control the speed of a servo which turns a color wheel. A color sensor breakout board then reads the color. The computer changes the color of an RGB LED and outputs a musical tone which can be heard on headphones connected to a plugable USB. This plugable USB is connected to a USB to micro-USB converter, which in turn can get plugged into this PCB.

Enjoy it!
